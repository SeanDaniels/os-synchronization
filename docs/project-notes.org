#+TITLE: Project Notes
- Assembly implementation of test_and_set function
- Use the following declaration
  #+BEGIN_SRC C
uint32 test_and_set(uint32 *ptr, uint32 new_value);
  #+END_SRC
- conceptually implement the following:
  #+BEGIN_SRC C
uint32 test_and_set(uint32 *ptr, uint32 new_value){
    uint32 old_value = *ptr;
    *ptr = new_value;
    return old_value;
}
  #+END_SRC
- [[https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/xchg][XCHG â€” Exchange Register/Memory with Register]]
- Exchanges the content of the first and second operands
- If a memory operand is referenced, locking protocol automatically implemented for the duration of the exchange operation
- I want pointer to be set to new value
- I want to return the old value
- xchg *ptr new_value
- I want contents of ptr to be saved as old value
- I want contents of ptr to be updated to new value
- I want old value to be returned
